                        as a Software Engineer!</p>

                        <p className="summary">My career transition started when I worked as a Paralegal. I created workflows to help with tasks, worked on cases 
                        that required a lot of information to be processed, and organized data and documents to improve efficiency. To achieve this, I worked with a 
                        Software Sales Representative and the Law Firm Manager to implement legal case management software and migrate information to the cloud. Through 
                        this experience, I discovered my desire to build impactful software.</p>

                        <p className="summary">When I pursued my Master's of Science in Computer Science, my dedication and enjoyment in learning and developing software, 
                        applications, and distributed systems to solve problems continued to grow. I created a full-stack web application that would help a group of end 
                        users collaborates on a trip and designed a distributed system that was scalable and highly available.</p>

                        <p className="summary">As a recent graduate, I am looking for a Software Engineer position where I can apply my skills and knowledge to provide 
                        solutions.</p>
